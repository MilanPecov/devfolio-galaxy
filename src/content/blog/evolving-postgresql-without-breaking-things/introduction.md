# Introduction

To change a database is to change the world in miniature. It is an act of transformation, of restructuring something vast and interconnected while it continues to pulse with life. The database does not pause for us; it does not yield easily to our aspirations. Its architecture is built on the principles of order, consistency, and unbreakable rules. And yet, we must change it, we must move forwardâ€”without halting time itself.

In this journey, we will encounter resistance. PostgreSQL does not allow change without consequence. Every modification is an assertion of control over the system, an attempt to impose new order upon a structure already settled into its form. But we have tools. We have techniques. We can navigate this process, ensuring that the database evolves without collapsing under the weight of its own integrity.
