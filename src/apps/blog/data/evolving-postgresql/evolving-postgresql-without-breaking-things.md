To change a database is to change the world in miniature. It is an act of transformation, of restructuring something vast and interconnected while it continues to pulse with life. The database does not pause for us; it does not yield easily to our aspirations. Its architecture is built on the principles of order, consistency, and unbreakable rules. And yet, we must change it, we must move forward—without halting time itself.

In this journey, we will encounter resistance. PostgreSQL does not allow change without consequence. Every modification is an assertion of control over the system, an attempt to impose new order upon a structure already settled into its form. But we have tools. We have techniques. We can navigate this process, ensuring that the database evolves without collapsing under the weight of its own integrity.

This series will guide you through the processes, techniques, and principles necessary to evolve your PostgreSQL database without disrupting your live systems.

## What You'll Learn in This Series

- Understanding PostgreSQL's locking mechanisms and their impact on database operations
- Creating concurrent indexes to avoid blocking writes during migrations
- Adding foreign keys and constraints without locking tables
- Managing table bloat and fragmentation with minimal disruption
- Monitoring database operations during migrations to ensure system stability

Join me on this journey as we explore the art and science of evolving PostgreSQL databases while keeping your applications responsive and your users happy.
